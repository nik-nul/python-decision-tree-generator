# python-decision-tree-generator
generate simple decision tree if the code only contains if, else, return statement

I wrote this to finish the f**king Algorithm Design and Analysis homework

It asks me to draw a decision tree with 128 leaf nodes,,,

It's hard to understand,,,,,

Anyway I wrote this junk with help of claude 3.7 to deal with that.

Hope it will be useful if u met the same ridiculous homework
